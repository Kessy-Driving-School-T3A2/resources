## Possible Challanges Of Planning During Development Process

<details>
    <summary>Click here to expand</summary>

#### Possible challanges

During the actual implimentation of this planning, we might need to change certain plans which will depend on

- Regular feedback checking regarding the balance between our **Client's need** and **possible outcome** of certain feature plans

- As a Developer team, we will try our best to create the features as promised and deliver it to the customer, still there is a possiblity of having an issue regarding time managemant and implimenting **Client's need** as this project is a **part of our Academic Assessment** and the **time limit** to finish the project is **controlled** by the Academy.

#### Possible solution

- Providing the details information about any featurs implimentaton. **how client want's it to be done** vs **how it will look after being done**, and change the plan if required

- Weekly meeting with our **Client** for through discussion about **what our Client needs** and **what can be done** in the **provided time period**

## Project Management Methodology

Slack Private Messaging

## Task Delegation Methodology

When looking through Anthony's previous works during CoderAcademy there is a lack of attention to detail where CSS and presentation is concerned. Previously scoring averagely on the portfolio website. We decided that for a professional website for a client that it was for the best if Anthony stuck to the Back End of the website where he felt more comfortable. This decision was accepted by Syeda who is more comfortable as a Full Stack Developer being able to do Front End or Back End competently.
